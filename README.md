# How to use
1. In proxies.txt put your fresh HTTP proxies
2. Run install_and_run to install dependencies and run the generator

# How does it work
It's trying to generate valid invite code by generating random 16 letter long string which is being sent to discordapp.com to see if it's valid. 

**It can take few hours before you get valid nitro code, the time is depending on speed of your wifi and proxies.**
